Four years ago, I built a custom clock with off-the-shelf parts (Arduino Nano, DS3231 breakout, 32x8 MAX7219 LED Matrix, all on a breadboard with 2 buttons). Although it has worked very reliably, only needing a few battery replacements and resetting the nano a few times, I want to make a custom solution.

Using these connections (no STEMMA connectors, just 4 ICs wired on a PCB to same I2C bus with different addresses hard-set on each IC), I will probably make a similar PCB layout with these segments + a microcontroller (possibly a SMD rp2040-zero) with a RTC module and battery slot + controlls for time adjustment and screen brightness controll + an alarm feature. 
All rough ideas for now, I have some parts in mind but I will likely have to order the screens and a HT16K33(A) breakout board (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006831500717.html) to see if this idea is feasible. If it is, this will be pretty epic.
